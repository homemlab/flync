## IMPORTANT: Remeber to declare boolian variables as lower-case true or false

# Mandatory arguments
# (-o) Set path to output dir
output: /path/to/output/
# This is equivalent to the -f option of the CLI
# If set to false the software will expect an SRA accesion list as input isntead
# If set to true will expect directory with .fastq.gz reads and if reads are paired-end.
fastq:
  active: true
  path: /path/to/fastq
  paired: true # If false or unset will assume single-end
  # (-l) If fastq_mode: false then provide path to SRA list
  sra: /path/to/sra

# Optional arguments
# Name your run, the final files will use this as prefix
name: test_run
# (-s) Split the pipeline into steps (useful for limited computational power, allows to segment run)
# If set to true expects "split_step" to be set to one of the following
# Accepts the following strings: map, map-stats, assembly, kall, clean
split:
  active: false
  step:
  # (-c) If step chosen is kall, provide the metadata.csv file in metadata
  metadata: /path/to/metadata.csv
# (-g AND -a) For user provider reference genome
genome:
  active: true
  sequence: /path/to/genome.fa
  annotation: /path/to/genome.gtf
# (-m) Cutoff to apply to percentage of reads mapped to the reference genome (-m option)
map_cutoff: 50
# (-t) Number of threads to use in this run (default is 2 if unset)
threads: 2
